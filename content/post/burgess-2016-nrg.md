[Regulatory elements: Putting enhancers into context](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg.2016.74)

## Principle of *suboptimization*

The enhancer consists of low-affinity TF binding sites in a suboptimal syntax, in terms of flanking nucleotides and 
spacing between the sites. Optimizing the TF binding affinities can lead to ectopic expression. 

## Experiment

In sea squirt, 15 synthetic enhancers consisting of 2 ETS binding sites and a ZicL binding site. 
Only 2 show activities. Further manipulation confirm key roles for binding site orientation, spacing and flanking nucleotides.

## Lesson

Activity of enhancers depend on binding affinities of sites, flanking bases, 
site arrangement (orientation and spacing). For a particular enhancer, he desired activity level is not necessarily the strongest.
